# AWS Serverless MCP Server

## Overview

The AWS Serverless Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server is an open-source tool that combines AI assistance with serverless expertise to streamline how developers build serverless applications. It provides contextual guidance specific to serverless development, helping developers make informed decisions about architecture, implementation, and deployment throughout the entire application development lifecycle. With AWS Serverless MCP, developers can build reliable, efficient, and production-ready serverless applications with confidence.

Key benefits of the Serverless MCP Server include:
* AI-powered serverless development: Provides rich contextual information to AI coding assistants to ensure your serverless application aligns with AWS best practices.
* Comprehensive tooling: Offers tools for initialization, deployment, monitoring, and troubleshooting of serverless applications.
* Architecture guidance: Helps evaluate design choices and select optimal serverless patterns based on application needs. Offers recommendations on event sources, function boundaries, and service integrations.
* Operational best practices: Ensures alignment with AWS architectural principles. Suggests effective use of AWS services for event processing, data persistence, and service communication, and guides implementation of security controls, performance tuning, and cost optimization.
* Security-first approach: Implements built-in guardrails with read-only defaults and controlled access to sensitive data.

## Features
The set of tools provided by the Serverless MCP server can be broken down into four categories:

1. Serverless Application Lifecycle
  - Intialize, build, and deploy Serverless Application Model (SAM) applications with SAM CLI
  - Test Lambda functions locally and remotely
2. Web Application Deployment & Management
  - Deploy fullstack, frontend, and backend web applications onto AWS Serverless using Lambda Web Adapter.
  - Update frontend assets and optionally invaliate CloudFront caches
  - Create custom domain names, including certificate and DNS setup.
3. Observability
  - Retrieve and logs and metrics of serverless resources
4. Guidance, Templates, and Deployment Help
  - Provides guidance on AWS Lambda use-cases, selecting an IaC framework, and deployment process onto AWS Serverless
  - Provides sample SAM templates for different serverless application types from [Serverless Land](https://serverlessland.com/)
  - Provides schema types for different Lambda event sources and runtimes
  - Provides schema registry management and discovery for AWS EventBridge events
  - Enables type-safe Lambda function development with complete event schemas

## Prerequisites
- Have an AWS account with [credentials configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
- Install uv from [Astral](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) or the [GitHub README](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation)
- Install Python 3.10 or newer using uv python install 3.10 (or a more recent version)
- Install [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html)
- Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

## Installation

You can download the AWS Serverless MCP Server from GitHub. To get started using your favorite code assistant with MCP support, like Q Developer, Cursor or Cline.

Add the following code to your MCP client configuration. The Serverless MCP server uses the default AWS profile by default. Specify a value in AWS_PROFILE if you want to use a different profile. Similarly, adjust the AWS Region and log level values as needed.
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.aws-serverless-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "awslabs.aws-serverless-mcp-server@latest",
        "--allow-write",
        "--allow-sensitive-data-access"
      ],
      "env": {
          "AWS_PROFILE": "your-aws-profile",
          "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
        },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": [],
      "timeout": 60
    }
  }
}
```

### Using temporary credentials
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.aws-serverless-mcp-server": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["awslabs.aws-serverless-mcp-server@latest"],
        "env": {
          "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "your-temporary-access-key",
          "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "your-temporary-secret-key",
          "AWS_SESSION_TOKEN": "your-session-token",
          "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
        },
        "disabled": false,
        "autoApprove": [],
        "timeout": 60
    }
  }
}
```

## Serverless MCP Server configuration options
### `--allow-write`
Enables write access mode, which allows mutating operations and creation of public resources. By default, the server runs in read-only mode, which restricts operations to only perform read actions, preventing any changes to AWS resources.

Mutating operations:
* sam_deploy_tool: Deploys a SAM application into AWS Cloud using CloudFormation
* deploy_webapp: Generates SAM template and deploys a web application into AWS CloudFormation. Creates public resources, including Route 53 DNS records, and CloudFront distributions


### `--allow-sensitive-data-access`
Enables access to sensitive data such as logs. By default, the server restricts access to sensitive data.

Operations returning sensitive data:
* sam_logs_tool: Returns Lambda function logs and API Gateway logs

## Example usage

### Creating a Lambda Function with SAM

Example user prompt:

```
I want to build a simple backend for a todo app using Python and deploy it to the cloud with AWS Serverless. Can you help me create a new project called my-todo-app. It should include basic functionality to add and list todos. Once it's set up, please build and deploy it with all the necessary permissions. I don’t need to review the changeset before deployment.
```

This prompt would trigger the AI assistant to:
1. Initialize a new SAM project using a template.
2. Make modifications to code and infra for a todo app.
3. Build the SAM application
4. Deploy the application with CAPABILITY_IAM permissions

### Deploying a Web Application

Example user prompt:

```
I have a full-stack web app built with Node.js called my-web-app, and I want to deploy it to the cloud using AWS. Everything’s ready — both frontend and backend. Can you set it up and deploy it with AWS Lambda so it's live and works smoothly?
```

This prompt would trigger the AI assistant to use the deploy_webapp_tool to deploy the full stack application with the specified configuration.

### Working with EventBridge Schemas

Example user prompt:

```
I need to create a Lambda function that processes autoscaling events. Can you help me find the right event schema and implement type-safe event handling?
```

This prompt would trigger the AI assistant to:
1. Search for autoscaling event schemas in aws.events registry using search_schema_tool
2. Retrieve complete schema definition using describe_schema_tool
3. Generate type-safe handler code based on schema structure
4. Implement validation for required fields

## Security features
1. **AWS Authentication**: Uses AWS credentials from the environment for secure authentication
2. **TLS Verification**: Enforces TLS verification for all AWS API calls
3. **Resource Tagging**: Tags all created resources for traceability
4. **Least Privilege**: Uses IAM roles with appropriate permissions for CloudFormation templates

## Security considerations

### Production use cases
The AWS Serverless MCP Server can be used for production environments with proper security controls in place. For production use cases, consider the following:

* **Read-Only Mode by Default**: The server runs in read-only mode by default, which is safer for production environments. Only explicitly enable write access when necessary.
* **Disable auto-approve**: Require the user to approve each time the AI assitant executes a tool

### Role scoping recommendations
To follow security best practices:

1. **Create dedicated IAM roles** to be used by the AWS Serverless MCP Server with the principle of least privilege
2. **Use separate roles** for read-only and write operations
3. **Implement resource tagging** to limit actions to resources created by the server
4. **Enable AWS CloudTrail** to audit all API calls made by the server
5. **Regularly review** the permissions granted to the server's IAM role
6. **Use IAM Access Analyzer** to identify unused permissions that can be removed

### Sensitive information handling
**IMPORTANT**: Do not pass secrets or sensitive information via allowed input mechanisms:

- Do not include secrets or credentials in CloudFormation templates
- Do not pass sensitive information directly in the prompt to the model
