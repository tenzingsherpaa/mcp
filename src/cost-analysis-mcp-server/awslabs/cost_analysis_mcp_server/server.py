    REQUIRED WORKFLOW:
    Analyze costs of AWS services by following these steps in order:

    1. Primary Data Source:
       - MUST first invoke get_pricing_from_web() to scrape pricing from AWS pricing page

    2. Fallback Mechanism 1:
       - If web scraping fails, MUST use get_pricing_from_api() to fetch data via AWS Pricing API

    3. For Bedrock Services:
       - When analyzing Amazon Bedrock services, MUST also use get_bedrock_patterns()
       - This provides critical architecture patterns, component relationships, and cost considerations
       - Especially important for Knowledge Base, Agent, Guardrails, and Data Automation services

    4. Report Generation:
       - MUST generate cost analysis report using retrieved data via generate_cost_report()
       - The report includes sections for:
         * Service Overview
         * Architecture Pattern (for Bedrock services)
         * Assumptions
         * Limitations and Exclusions
         * Cost Breakdown
         * Cost Scaling with Usage
         * AWS Well-Architected Cost Optimization Recommendations

    5. Output:
       Return to user:
       - Detailed cost analysis report in markdown format
       - Source of the data (web scraping, API, or websearch)
       - List of attempted data retrieval methods

    ACCURACY GUIDELINES:
    - When uncertain about service compatibility or pricing details, EXCLUDE them rather than making assumptions
    - For database compatibility, only include CONFIRMED supported databases
    - For model comparisons, always use the LATEST models rather than specific named ones
    - Add clear disclaimers about what is NOT included in calculations
    - PROVIDING LESS INFORMATION IS BETTER THAN GIVING WRONG INFORMATION
    - For Bedrock Knowledge Base, ALWAYS account for OpenSearch Serverless minimum OCU requirements (2 OCUs, $345.60/month minimum)
    - For Bedrock Agent, DO NOT double-count foundation model costs (they're included in agent usage)

    IMPORTANT: Steps MUST be executed in this exact order. Each step must be attempted
    before moving to the next fallback mechanism. The report is particularly focused on
    serverless services and pay-as-you-go pricing models.""",

- ALWAYS specify the pricing model (e.g., "ON DEMAND")
