        Deletes ECS infrastructure created by the ECS MCP Server.

        WARNING: This tool is not intended for production usage and is best suited for
        tearing down prototyped work done with the ECS MCP Server.

        This tool attempts to identify and delete CloudFormation stacks based on the
        provided app name and template files. It will scan the user's CloudFormation stacks,
        using the app name as a heuristic, and identify if the templates match the files
        provided in the input. It will only attempt to delete stacks if they are found and
        match the provided templates.

        USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
        1. Provide the name of your application
        2. Provide paths to the ECR and ECS CloudFormation template files
           - Templates will be compared to ensure they match the deployed stacks
        3. The tool will attempt to delete the stacks in the correct order (ECS first, then ECR)

        IMPORTANT:
        - This is a best-effort deletion
        - If a stack is in a transitional state (e.g., CREATE_IN_PROGRESS), it will be skipped
        - You may need to manually delete resources if the deletion fails

        Parameters:
            app_name: Name of the application
            ecr_template_path: Path to the ECR CloudFormation template file
            ecs_template_path: Path to the ECS CloudFormation template file

        Returns:
