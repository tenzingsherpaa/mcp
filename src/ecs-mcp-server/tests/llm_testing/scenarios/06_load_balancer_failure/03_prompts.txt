# Load Balancer Health Check Failure - Test Prompts

The following prompts can be used to test Claude's ability to diagnose and troubleshoot ECS service load balancer health check issues.

## General Troubleshooting Prompt

I've deployed an ECS service "[SERVICE_NAME]" in cluster "[CLUSTER_NAME]" that's integrated with a load balancer, but the service isn't accessible through the load balancer. When I access the load balancer URL, I get a 502 Bad Gateway error. The tasks seem to be running, but something is wrong with the load balancer integration. Can you help me troubleshoot this issue?

## Testing get_ecs_troubleshooting_guidance Tool

I need help diagnosing issues with my ECS service "[SERVICE_NAME]" in cluster "[CLUSTER_NAME]". The service is running, but the load balancer health checks are failing. Can you use the get_ecs_troubleshooting_guidance tool to analyze what might be causing these health check failures?

## Testing fetch_service_events Tool

My ECS service "[SERVICE_NAME]" in cluster "[CLUSTER_NAME]" appears to be having issues with load balancer health checks. Can you use the fetch_service_events tool to check if there are any events or messages that might explain why the health checks are failing?

## Testing ecs_resource_management Tool

I'm having issues with my ECS service "[SERVICE_NAME]" in cluster "[CLUSTER_NAME]" which is integrated with a load balancer. The tasks are running but not being marked as healthy by the load balancer. Can you use the ecs_resource_management tool to examine the service and task definition configuration to identify any load balancer integration issues?

## Testing Cross-Tool Integration

My ECS Fargate service "[SERVICE_NAME]" in cluster "[CLUSTER_NAME]" is running properly, but the load balancer health checks are failing, causing a 502 error when accessing the load balancer URL. Can you perform a comprehensive diagnosis using multiple tools to identify the issue with the load balancer health checks?

## Expected Results

Claude should identify:
1. The target group health check is configured to check an incorrect path (/nonexistent-path) that doesn't exist in the nginx container
2. The health check failures prevent traffic from being routed to the container
3. The solution is to modify the target group's health check path to "/" or another valid path in the nginx container
