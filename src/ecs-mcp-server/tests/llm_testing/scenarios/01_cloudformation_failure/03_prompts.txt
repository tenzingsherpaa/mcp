## Test Prompts

# Prompt 1: Basic Problem Statement
I deployed an ECS application using CloudFormation with a stack named "<STACK_NAME>", but the deployment failed. Can you help me troubleshoot what went wrong and how to fix it?

# Prompt 2: Technical User Scenario
I'm trying to deploy a Fargate service using CloudFormation (stack name: "<STACK_NAME>"), but I'm getting a rollback. Could you use your troubleshooting tools to diagnose the issue and tell me what's wrong with my template?

# Prompt 3: Confused Beginner Scenario
I'm new to AWS and trying to learn ECS. I followed a tutorial to deploy something called a "Fargate service" using CloudFormation, but it's not working. My stack is called "<STACK_NAME>" and it says something about a rollback. Can you explain what's happening in simple terms and how to fix it?

# Prompt 4: Specific Error Focus
My CloudFormation stack "<STACK_NAME>" failed during creation. I think there might be an issue with my ECS service configuration, but I'm not sure what exactly is wrong. Can you look into this?

# Prompt 5: Minimal Information
My stack "<STACK_NAME>" is broken. Help me fix it.

IMPORTANT: Replace <STACK_NAME> with the actual stack name generated during testing
