# Prompts for ECS Service Image Pull Failure Scenario

## Expected Observed Failure
When running 02_validate.sh, you should see output similar to:
```
âœ… Service has failed tasks as expected.
Service events (showing image pull failures):
[
    "service failing-service-abcde was unable to place a task because no container instance met all of its requirements.",
    "(deployment ecs-svc/9876543210987) Failed to start task: failed to pull the image configuration: pull access denied for non-existent-repo/non-existent-image",
    "failed to register targets in target group arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:..."
]
```

## Test Prompts

# Prompt 1: Basic Problem Statement
I've deployed an ECS service named "<SERVICE_NAME>" in my cluster "<CLUSTER_NAME>", but it's not starting up properly. The tasks keep failing. Can you help me figure out what's wrong?

# Prompt 2: Technical User Scenario
I've got a Fargate service in ECS that's failing to pull the container image. The cluster is "<CLUSTER_NAME>" and service is "<SERVICE_NAME>". Can you use your tools to diagnose what's happening and explain how I can fix it?

# Prompt 3: Confused Beginner Scenario
I'm learning AWS and tried to run something called a "service" in ECS, but it keeps stopping immediately. The cluster is called "<CLUSTER_NAME>" and the service is "<SERVICE_NAME>". When I look at it in the console, it says something about tasks failing. What does this mean and how do I fix it?

# Prompt 4: Specific Error Focus
My ECS service "<SERVICE_NAME>" in cluster "<CLUSTER_NAME>" is having issues with the container image. I can see in the events that there's a problem, but I don't understand how to resolve it. Can you diagnose this?

# Prompt 5: Minimal Information
My ECS tasks keep failing in cluster "<CLUSTER_NAME>". Help me fix it.

IMPORTANT: Replace <CLUSTER_NAME> and <SERVICE_NAME> with the actual names generated during testing
