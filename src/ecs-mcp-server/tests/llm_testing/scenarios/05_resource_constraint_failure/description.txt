Tests ECS task resource constraint failures by creating tasks with very high CPU/memory requirements that exceed available resources. The test creates a task that first installs the stress tool and then attempts to allocate 118GB of memory using the stress tool. This is designed to trigger resource constraint failures since it's at the edge of Fargate's maximum memory limits (120GB). Tests the fetch_task_failures tool and get_ecs_troubleshooting_guidance tool.
