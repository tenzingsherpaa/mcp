# ECS Test Script Improvements

This document describes the improvements made to the ECS test scripts to address validation failures and optimize troubleshooting.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. VPC/Security Group Mismatch Issue
The scripts were selecting random subnets and security groups that could potentially belong to different VPCs, causing this error:
```
An error occurred (InvalidParameterException) when calling the RunTask operation: Security group sg-0dd8a777c45711f1d does not appear to belong to the same VPC as the input subnets.
```

### 2. JSON Formatting Issue
The task exit failure script had multiline command strings with newlines that caused JSON parsing errors:
```
Error parsing parameter '--container-definitions': Invalid JSON: Invalid control character
```

### 3. Validation Timing Issue
Validation scripts were failing when tasks hadn't yet completed, causing unnecessary troubleshooting:
```
No stopped tasks found in cluster. If you just created the task, wait a few moments for it to run and exit.
```

## Improvements Made

### 1. VPC-Aware Resource Selection
Modified both the task failure and service failure scripts to:
- Explicitly identify the default VPC
- Get a subnet from that specific VPC
- Get a security group from that same VPC
- Use these compatible resources for network configuration

```bash
# Get default VPC
VPC_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-vpcs --filters "Name=isDefault,Values=true" --query "Vpcs[0].VpcId" --output text)

# Get a subnet from this VPC
SUBNET_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-subnets --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC_ID" --query "Subnets[0].SubnetId" --output text)

# Get a security group from this VPC
SG_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC_ID" --query "SecurityGroups[0].GroupId" --output text)
```

### 2. JSON Formatting Fix
Fixed the task exit script's JSON formatting error by consolidating the multiline command into a single line.

### 3. Auto-Retry Validation Logic
Enhanced both validation scripts to:
- Implement automatic retries with configurable intervals
- Check for tasks in multiple states (RUNNING, PENDING, STOPPED)
- Search service events for failure patterns
- Provide better diagnostic information when services/tasks don't exist or fail

### 4. Improved Error Diagnostics
- Better fallback strategies when services are not found
- Better checking for task definition existence

## Testing Impact

These improvements will make the ECS troubleshooting testing more reliable by:

1. **Eliminating Infrastructure Errors**: Ensuring resources are from the same VPC prevents networking errors
2. **Reducing False Negatives**: Auto-retries give time for tasks to complete their failure cycle
3. **Improving Diagnostics**: Better error messages and fallback strategies
4. **Increasing Efficiency**: More accurate failure detection reduces unnecessary tool usage

## Next Steps

These improvements address the immediate issues with the test scripts. For future enhancements, consider:

1. Implementing a more comprehensive health check in the initial guidance tool that can detect common issues like incompatible VPC resources
2. Adding a dedicated command to check ECR repositories and image availability
3. Creating a deployment history tool that shows all past deployment attempts
