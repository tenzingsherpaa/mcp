    """Create and return an AWS service client with dynamically detected credentials.

    This function implements a credential provider chain that tries different
    credential sources in the following order:
    1. Environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
    2. Shared credential file (~/.aws/credentials)
    3. IAM role for Amazon EC2 / ECS task role / EKS pod identity
    4. AWS SSO or Web Identity token

    The function caches clients based on the compound key of service_name and region_name
    to avoid creating duplicate clients for the same service and region.

    Args:
        service_name: AWS service name (e.g., 'cloudcontrol', 'logs', 'marketplace-catalog')
        region_name: AWS region name (defaults to environment variable or 'us-east-1')

    Returns:
        Boto3 client for the specified service
