# Amazon EKS MCP Server

The Amazon EKS MCP server provides AI code assistants with resource management tools and real-time cluster state visibility. This provides large language models (LLMs) with essential tooling and contextual awareness, enabling AI code assistants to streamline application development through tailored guidance — from initial setup through production optimization and troubleshooting.

Integrating the EKS MCP server into AI code assistants enhances development workflow across all phases, from simplifying initial cluster setup with automated prerequisite creation and application of best practices. Further, it streamlines application deployment with high-level workflows and automated code generation. Finally, it accelerates troubleshooting through intelligent debugging tools and knowledge base access. All of this simplifies complex operations through natural language interactions in AI code assistants.

## Key features

* Enables users of AI code assistants to create new EKS clusters, complete with prerequisites such as dedicated VPCs, networking, and EKS Auto Mode node pools, by translating requests into the appropriate AWS CloudFormation actions.
* Provides the ability to deploy containerized applications by applying existing Kubernetes YAML files or by generating new deployment and service manifests based on user-provided parameters.
* Supports full lifecycle management of individual Kubernetes resources (such as Pods, Services, and Deployments) within EKS clusters, enabling create, read, update, patch, and delete operations.
* Provides the ability to list Kubernetes resources with filtering by namespace, labels, and fields, simplifying the process for both users and LLMs to gather information about the state of Kubernetes applications and EKS infrastructure.
* Facilitates operational tasks such as retrieving logs from specific pods and containers or fetching Kubernetes events related to particular resources, supporting troubleshooting and monitoring for both direct users and AI-driven workflows.
* Enables users to troubleshoot issues with an EKS cluster.

## Prerequisites

  ]
}
```

## Quickstart

This quickstart guide walks you through the steps to configure the Amazon EKS MCP Server for use with both the [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/en/downloads) IDE and the [Amazon Q Developer CLI](https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-developer-cli). By following these steps, you'll setup your development environment to leverage the EKS MCP Server's tools for managing your Amazon EKS clusters and Kubernetes resources.

**Set up Cursor**

1. Open Cursor.
2. Click the gear icon (⚙️) in the top right to open the settings panel, click **MCP**, **Add new global MCP server**.
3. Paste your MCP server definition. For example, this example shows how to configure the EKS MCP Server, including enabling mutating actions by adding the `--allow-write` flag to the server arguments:

	```
	{
	  "mcpServers": {
	    "awslabs.eks-mcp-server": {
	      "autoApprove": [],
	      "disabled": false,
	      "command": "uvx",
	      "args": [
	        "awslabs.eks-mcp-server@latest",
	        "--allow-write"
	      ],
	      "env": {
	        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
	      },
	      "transportType": "stdio"
	    }
	  }
	}
	```

	After a few minutes, you should see a green indicator if your MCP server definition is valid.

4. Open a chat panel in Cursor (e.g., `Ctrl/⌘ + L`).  In your Cursor chat window, enter your prompt. For example, "Create a new EKS cluster named 'my-test-cluster' in the 'us-west-2' region using Kubernetes version 1.31."

**Set up the Amazon Q Developer CLI**

1. Install the [Amazon Q Developer CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line-installing.html) .
2. The Q Developer CLI supports MCP servers for tools and prompts out-of-the-box. Edit your Q developer CLI's MCP configuration file named mcp.json following [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line-mcp-configuration.html). For example:

	```
	{
	  "mcpServers": {
	    "awslabs.eks-mcp-server": {
	      "command": "uvx",
	      "args": ["awslabs.eks-mcp-server@latest"],
	      "env": {
	        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
	      },
	      "autoApprove": [],
	      "disabled": false
	    }
	  }
	}
	```

3. Verify your setup by running the `/tools` command in the Q Developer CLI to see the available EKS MCP tools.

Note that this is a basic quickstart. You can enable additional capabilities, such as [running MCP servers in containers](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#running-mcp-servers-in-containers) or combining more MCP servers like the [AWS Documentation MCP Server](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/aws-documentation-mcp-server/) into a single MCP server definition. To view an example, see the [Installation and Setup](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-and-setup) guide in AWS MCP Servers on GitHub. To view a real-world implementation with application code in context with an MCP server, see the [Server Developer](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server) guide in Anthropic documentation.

## Security & permissions

### Features

The EKS MCP Server implements the following security features:

1. **AWS Authentication**: Uses AWS credentials from the environment for secure authentication.
2. **Kubernetes Authentication**: Generates temporary credentials for Kubernetes API access.
3. **SSL Verification**: Enforces SSL verification for all Kubernetes API calls.
4. **Resource Tagging**: Tags all created resources for traceability.
5. **Least Privilege**: Uses IAM roles with appropriate permissions for CloudFormation templates.
6. **Stack Protection**: Ensures CloudFormation stacks can only be modified by the tool that created them.
7. **Client Caching**: Caches Kubernetes clients with TTL-based expiration for security and performance.

### Considerations

When using the EKS MCP Server, consider the following:

* **AWS Credentials**: The server needs permission to create and manage EKS resources.
* **Kubernetes Access**: The server generates temporary credentials for Kubernetes API access.
* **Network Security**: Configure VPC and security groups properly for EKS clusters.
* **Authentication**: Use appropriate authentication mechanisms for Kubernetes resources.
* **Authorization**: Configure RBAC properly for Kubernetes resources.
* **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive data in Kubernetes secrets.
* **Logging and Monitoring**: Enable logging and monitoring for EKS clusters.

### Permissions

The EKS MCP Server can be used for production environments with proper security controls in place. The server runs in read-only mode by default, which is recommended and considered generally safer for production environments. Only explicitly enable write access when necessary. Below are the EKS MCP server tools available in read-only versus write-access mode:

* **Read-only mode (default)**: `manage_eks_stacks` (with operation="describe"), `manage_k8s_resource` (with operation="read"), `list_k8s_resources`, `get_pod_logs`, `get_k8s_events`, `get_cloudwatch_logs`, `get_cloudwatch_metrics`, `get_policies_for_role`, `search_eks_troubleshoot_guide`, `list_api_versions`.
* **Write-access mode**: (require `--allow-write`): `manage_eks_stacks` (with "generate", "deploy", "delete"), `manage_k8s_resource` (with "create", "replace", "patch", "delete"), `apply_yaml`, `generate_app_manifest`, `add_inline_policy`.

#### `autoApprove` (optional)

An array within the MCP server definition that lists tool names to be automatically approved by the EKS MCP Server client, bypassing user confirmation for those specific tools. For example:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.eks-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "awslabs.eks-mcp-server@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AWS_PROFILE": "eks-mcp-readonly-profile",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1",
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "INFO"
      },
      "autoApprove": [
        "manage_eks_stacks",
        "manage_k8s_resource",
        "list_k8s_resources",
        "get_pod_logs",
        "get_k8s_events",
        "get_cloudwatch_logs",
        "get_cloudwatch_metrics",
        "get_policies_for_role",
        "search_eks_troubleshoot_guide",
        "list_api_versions"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### IAM Permissions Management

When the `--allow-write` flag is enabled, the EKS MCP Server can create missing IAM permissions for EKS resources through the `add_inline_policy` tool. This tool enables the following:

* Only creates new inline policies; it never modifies existing policies.
* Is useful for automatically fixing common permissions issues with EKS clusters.
* Should be used with caution and with properly scoped IAM roles.

### Role Scoping Recommendations

In accordance with security best practices, we recommend the following:

1. **Create dedicated IAM roles** to be used by the EKS MCP Server with the principle of "least privilege."
2. **Use separate roles** for read-only and write operations.
3. **Implement resource tagging** to limit actions to resources created by the server.
4. **Enable AWS CloudTrail** to audit all API calls made by the server.
5. **Regularly review** the permissions granted to the server's IAM role.
6. **Use IAM Access Analyzer** to identify unused permissions that can be removed.

### Sensitive Information Handling

**IMPORTANT**: Do not pass secrets or sensitive information via allowed input mechanisms:

* Do not include secrets or credentials in YAML files applied with `apply_yaml`.
* Do not pass sensitive information directly in the prompt to the model.
* Do not include secrets in CloudFormation templates or application manifests.
* Avoid using MCP tools for creating Kubernetes Secrets, as this would require providing the secret data to the model.

**YAML Content Security**:

* Only use YAML files from trustworthy sources.
* The server relies on Kubernetes API validation for YAML content and does not perform its own validation.
* Audit YAML files before applying them to your cluster.

**Instead of passing secrets through MCP**:

* Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store to store sensitive information.
* Configure proper Kubernetes RBAC for service accounts.
* Use IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA) for AWS service access from pods.

## General Best Practices

* **Resource Naming**: Use descriptive names for EKS clusters and Kubernetes resources.
* **Namespace Usage**: Organize resources into namespaces for better management.
* **Error Handling**: Check for errors in tool responses and handle them appropriately.
* **Resource Cleanup**: Delete unused resources to avoid unnecessary costs.
* **Monitoring**: Monitor cluster and resource status regularly.
* **Security**: Follow AWS security best practices for EKS clusters.
* **Backup**: Regularly backup important Kubernetes resources.

## General Troubleshooting

* **Permission Errors**: Verify that your AWS credentials have the necessary permissions.
* **CloudFormation Errors**: Check the CloudFormation console for stack creation errors.
* **Kubernetes API Errors**: Verify that the EKS cluster is running and accessible.
* **Network Issues**: Check VPC and security group configurations.
* **Client Errors**: Verify that the MCP client is configured correctly.
* **Log Level**: Increase the log level to DEBUG for more detailed logs.

For general EKS issues, consult the [Amazon EKS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/).
